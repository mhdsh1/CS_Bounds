CS_Bounds Summer 2024

This repository contains the code for the CS_Bounds project. The primary goal 
of the project is to provide Stata ado files for the methods described in the paper "Evaluating the Impact of Regulatory Policies on Social Welfare in Difference-in-Difference Settings" (Ghanem et al., 2024).

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- code: Contains the ado files in the ado_files subfolder. All ado files are 
called in the Stata do file main.do.
- data: Includes the data used for analysis.
- input: Contains any input files used in the project.
- output: Stores the results and outputs generated by the code.

Ado Files and Main Script

In the code/ado_files folder, you will find three ado files. These ado files 
are called by the Stata do file main.do, which replicates the analysis 
performed in the R script main.R.

Before running main.do, ensure that:

1. The ado files are installed in your Stata ado directory.
2. The version of the ado files is compatible with your version of Stata.

The current ado files were written for Stata 14.

Data

The main.do script runs on the dataset CPS_cleaned_merged_yearly_10_to_15, 
which contains data on the minimum wage for the years 2010 and 2015. This 
dataset was built using the code in CPS_cleaned_merged_yearly_10_to_15.do, 
based on the replication files from the main paper.

Outputs

All outputs from both main.R and main.do are saved in the output folder.

You can find the work done by the previous research assistant, Alvaro, in the 
folder CPS_cleaned_merged_yearly_10_to_15.
